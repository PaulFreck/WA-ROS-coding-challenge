# WA-ROS-coding-challenge
please note that the merge_array_nodes only publishes 1 response for every array it gets in (except for the 1st array, which it does nothing with) if you prefer the functionality to be a continious publishing of arrays regardless of if there has been a new array published to the subscribed you may want to create a timer object I did not impliment thise because i did not feel that it was what was needed.
